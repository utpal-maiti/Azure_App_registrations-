**Microsoft Entra ID** (formerly Azure Active Directory) is a cloud-based identity and access management service that helps organizations manage user identities and access to resources. It provides a range of features to secure and streamline access to applications and services.

### Key Features of Microsoft Entra ID

1. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Allows users to sign in once and access multiple applications without needing to re-enter credentials.
2. **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds an extra layer of security by requiring multiple forms of verification.
3. **Conditional Access**: Applies access controls based on conditions such as user location, device compliance, and risk level.
4. **Identity Protection**: Detects and responds to identity-based threats and vulnerabilities.
5. **Privileged Identity Management**: Helps manage, control, and monitor access to critical resources.
6. **Application Management**: Integrates with thousands of SaaS applications and supports custom app integrations.

### App Registrations in Microsoft Entra ID

To use Microsoft Entra ID for authentication and access management, you need to register your applications. This establishes a trust relationship between your app and the identity provider. Here’s how to register an app:

1. **Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center**: Use an account with at least the Cloud Application Administrator role.
2. **Navigate to App Registrations**: Go to Identity > Applications > App registrations and select New registration.
3. **Enter App Details**: Provide a display name, specify who can use the app, and configure other settings.
4. **Add Redirect URIs**: Specify the URIs where the app will send responses after authentication.
5. **Generate Client ID and Secret**: These credentials will be used by your app to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID.

### Benefits of App Registrations

- **Security**: Ensures that only authorized applications can access protected resources.
- **Simplicity**: Streamlines the process of integrating apps with Microsoft Entra ID for seamless user experiences.
- **Scalability**: Supports a wide range of applications, from single-tenant LOB apps to multitenant SaaS apps.
